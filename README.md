# CPE_203-Actual_Final

This is a final project for 203. It was a quarter long project with five parts.

1) Refactor. Move all static methods into classes that they fit better in.
2) Create interfaces for logical groupings of similar or identical code.
3) Create abstract classes for more connected and streamlined code, allowing for less repetition of code.
4) Create a pathing strategy using a strategy design pattern, and then implement the A* algorithm for pathing.
5) Modify the game to support a world-changing event on a mouse click, including a new entity, modified behavior of exisiting entities, and factory design pattern implementation.
